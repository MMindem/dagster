# Tutorial

If you're new to Dagster, we recommend working through this tutorial to become
familiar with Dagster's feature set and tooling, using small examples that are
intended to be illustrative of real data problems.

## Intro Tutorial

The tutorial is divided into several sections:

- [**Setup for the Tutorial**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/setup) will give you a starting point to follow the
  tutorial.
- [**A Single-Solid Pipeline**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/execute) will teach you ways to construct and execute a
  simple data pipeline.
- [**Connecting Solids in Pipelines**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/basics_pipelines) will teach you the basics of using
  pipelines.
- [**Configuring Solids**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/basics_solids) will teach you the basics of using solids.
- [**Testing Solids and Pipelines**](/tutorial/intro-tutorial/testable) will show you how to test your solids and
  pipelines.

## Advanced Tutorials

These sections will introduce some advanced features and give you deeper insight into Dagster.

- [**Advanced: Dagster Types**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/types) covers Dagster's type system.
- [**Advanced: Solid Re-use and Composition**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/solids) demonstrates more ways you can
  use solids, e.g. by creating reusable solids.
- [**Advanced: Pipelines**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/pipelines) demonstrates configuring
  pipeline-wide facilities to avoiding repeated code or config with unchanged business logic.
- [**Advanced: Materializations**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/materializations) demonstrates a way to
  make Dagster aware of your persistent artifacts outside the system.
- [**Advanced: Organizing Pipelines in Repositories & Workspaces**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/repositories)
  demonstrates constructs that are useful when you have many pipelines that you need to organize.
- [**Advanced: Scheduling Pipeline Runs**](/tutorial/advanced-tutorial/scheduling) will show you how to
  schedule pipelines to run at regular intervals using cron.
